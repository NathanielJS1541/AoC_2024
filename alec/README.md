# Alec AOC attempt

no i dont know what i'm doing, no i'm not committing to finishing this properly either. Lets see how many aneurysms it takes to get through this :D

## Day 1

seemed easy enough i think?

## Day 2

Part 1 needs either recognition for the fact its written in accidental inverse logic, or to be lenny and the rabbit-ed.

Part 2 could most likely have been done in a better way but manually separating them seemed quicker than figuring out how else to do it...

## Day 3

Part 1 possible using only the textsplit using deliminators purely because there's no instances of whitespaces that discount vaild data. If there was like as described in the example, this probably wouldn't have worked :(

Part 2 why did i do this to myself
