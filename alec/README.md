# Alec AOC attempt

no i dont know what i'm doing, no i'm not committing to finishing this properly either. Lets see how many aneurysms it takes to get through this :D

## Day 1

seemed easy enough i think?

## Day 2

Part 1 needs either recognition for the fact its written in accidental inverse logic, or to be lenny and the rabbit-ed.

Part 2 could most likely have been done in a better way but manually separating them seemed quicker than figuring out how else to do it...
