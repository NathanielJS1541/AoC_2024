## Requirements

### Input Data

The input data can be obtained from the
[Day 2 Advent of Code page](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2). You'll need to
sign in to get a puzzle input.

### PowerShell

I'm targeting the,
[cross-platform PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), rather
than the built-in Windows PowerShell. I expect it should work on both, but just
in case it doesn't here's your warning I guess...

## Getting Started

To run the `pwsh` script, navigate to this folder in a `pwsh` window and run the
following command:

```pwsh
.\Day02.ps1 -InputPath <path_to_input_data>
```
