## Getting Started

### Cloning the repo

In order to make contributions to this repo, you will need to authenticate `git`
with your GitHub account. The easiest way to do this is to use
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/), as it should handle this
for you.

Alternatively, create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens),
or set up [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).

After this is set up, you can either `clone` this repo using GitHub desktop,
using the command line with
`git clone https://github.com/NathanielJS1541/AoC_2024.git`, or if you're using
SSH do `git clone git@github.com:NathanielJS1541/AoC_2024.git`.

### Contribution Guidelines

This should just prevent treading on each others toes, and loss of work etc.

- Do not commit any of the puzzle texts or inputs from Advent of Code to this
  repo, as AoC does not allow redistribution.
- Work in your own branch, and create a
  [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
  to merge your work into main periodically. You can complete this PR yourself,
  but it makes it easy to identify what was added by who.
- Avoid rebasing. This has the potential to create confusing scenarios for
  others, or overwrite others work if they have based work on a commit that you
  rebase.
- Do not `git push --force` into shared branches! People can and will lose work
  this way.
- Create your own named folder inside the root of this repo to reflect your
  name, for example `AoC_2024/bob`. From there you can structure it however you
  like, and create your own README.md that can be linked to the
  [contributors](#contributors) section below.
- Use a `.gitignore` file locally within your own folder. `.gitignore` files are
  applied to the directory they are in, and any subdirectories below that.
  Because there will be lots of additions to the `.gitignore` file with each
  language people use, having them within your own folder means they can be
  customised to the languages you are using much easier. GitHub maintains a
  [repo of .gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) if you
  need some inspiration.
- There is a `.gitignore` in the root of the repo, which contains the
  `.gitignore` templates for various common IDE's (Visual Studio, VSCode,
  JetBrains etc.). If your IDE needs some files ignored in the `.gitignore`, it
  should be added here to ensure any dotfiles your IDE generates when you open
  the repo are ignored, as these are usually placed in the root.
